GSMSMS - Release v0.2.1 on 10/12/2008
=====================================
Link: http://code.google.com/p/gsmsms/

For license and copyright, please see the LICENSE file.


Usage
=====
On the command line: -

% python sendsms.py

 OR

% python receivesms.py

 OR

% python smsserver.py

 OR

% python webfrontend.py

This will output the arguments which you need to pass to send/receive an SMS, SMS server, or fire up the web frontend for the SMS server.


Current Features
================
1. Sends an SMS in TEXT mode using a GSM modem
2. Receives SMS and then e-mails them to where the user has defined
3. A server component which combines points 1 and 2 (you can add messages to the queue using the "-a" option - more information in "usage")
4. Very basic web frontend for sending SMS messages using the SMS server component

Future Features
===============
1. Support PDU mode - mobile phones tend to only support this mode

"Maybe" Future Features
=======================
1. Get the SMS server to monitor a mailbox and send SMS from an e-mail


Installation
============
FreeBSD
^^^^^^^

Here are the packages I've currently got installed for GSMSMS to work: -

================================================================================================================================
Name			|	Download From		|	Directory
========================+===============================+=======================================================================
py25-serial		|	Ports			|	/usr/ports/comms/py-serial
python25		|	Ports			|	/usr/ports/lang/python
================================================================================================================================

You can install them in any order, you might want to make sure the your ports collection is up-to-date.  Python 2.5 is normally installed by default.


Linux - (X/K)Ubuntu/Debian
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enter the following commands in a terminal session: -

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-serial

Linux - Red Hat/CentOS/etc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TO DO.


Microsoft Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the following packages IN ORDER (later versions should be fine): -

================================================================================================================================================================================
Name						|	Download From
================================================+===============================================================================================================================
python-2.5.2.msi				|	http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.2/python-2.5.2.msi
Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.5.exe			|	http://rene.f0o.com/%7Erene/stuff/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.5.exe
pywin32-211.win32-py2.5.exe			|	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pywin32/pywin32-211.win32-py2.5.exe?modtime=1212253052&big_mirror=0&filesize=5381561
pyserial-2.4.win32.exe				|	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pyserial/pyserial-2.4.win32.exe?modtime=1215392805&big_mirror=0
================================================================================================================================================================================

Then you'll need to add the Python directory into your environment path.  Usually, "Control Panel"->"System"->"Advanced"->"Environment Variables"->"System Variables"->ADD ";C:\Python25" to the end of the PATH variable string.

Notice the semi-colon, this IS required otherwise the path won't be valid.


FAQ
===
Q. What are the dependencies for this program?
A. Python v2.4 or greater (>= v2.5 is preferred) and pyserial.  That's it!

Q. What operating systems does it support?
A. I develop and test GSMSMS with FreeBSD 7.0, it should work in other POSIX compliant operating systems as well as Linux.

Q. Can I create (port) of GSMSMS?
A. By all means! Be sure to read the LICENSE as your port will inherit the license.

Q. I've looked at your code and it's rubbish...
A. Thanks (!), I'm fairly new to Python so expect a few bugs!  If you can provide me with any pointers I'll be grateful.

Q. I've found a bug! What do I do?
A. Let me know on the forum so I can fix it in a future version.

Q. I would like a feature that's not in GSMSMS...
A. That's not a question, but let me know on the forum if it isn't in the future features at the top of this file!

Q. How often do you do updates?
A. I release them whenever I can, but I'll try to release an update at least once a month.  I'm currently in a full-time job and develop GSMSMS in my spare time so please, be patient!
